	# Vanilla translation.
	Creative: "Journey"
	# The English text is a Terraria/Mining-related pun on "I'm Too Young to Die" from DOOM 1.
	# Alternatively this can be something along the lines of "Mineshafts Scare Me", if that sounds more melodic.
	# Basically, the translation must a Terraria-related pun on something making light-hearted fun of players not yet being ready for more - "Hey, Not Too Rough!".
	Normal: "I'm Too Young to Mine"
	# The English text was originally "Bone Me Plenty", a Terraria/Skeleton-related pun on "Hurt Me Plenty" from DOOM 1, but got renamed to "Turn Me Undead" since then due to unintended sexual connotations.
	# If translating that can be done without them - that's valid.
	# Otherwise, the translation must be a Terraria-related pun on something slightly fearless or badass, along the lines of "Come At Me!", or "Give Me Pain".
	Expert: "Turn Me Undead"
	# The English text is a Terraria-related pun on "I Am Death Incarnate" of Wolfenstein (which quoted 'Babylon 5').
	# Basically, the translation must be a Terraria-related pun on something super empowering like "I AM A GOD", or exciting for dangers the way "Ultra Nightmare!" sounds.
